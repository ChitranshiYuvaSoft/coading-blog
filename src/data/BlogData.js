    description:
      "State management in React is one of the core concepts every developer must understand. It allows components to manage their dynamic data efficiently. In this blog, we will explore React's built-in `useState` and `useReducer` hooks, as well as external libraries like Redux and Zustand. By the end, you'll know how to decide between local state and global state for your application, and understand advanced concepts like React Context for passing data down the component tree without prop drilling.",

    description:
      "React's component lifecycle is pivotal in understanding how components are created, updated, and destroyed. In this blog, we take a deep dive into the lifecycle methods of class components, like `componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. Then, we explore how functional components achieve the same functionality using hooks like `useEffect`. Whether you're migrating from class-based to functional components or starting afresh, this blog provides detailed insights with examples.",
